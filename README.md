# Chat App with Socket.IO

This is a realtime chat app that I built while learning how to work with Socket.IO.

## Run Locally

### Environment Variables

-   #### EXPRESS_PORT (Port that server will listen on)
    Example: EXPRESS_PORT=5000

### Install/Run

1. Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MrTwister96/socketio-demo.git
```

2. Switch to repo directory

```bash
cd socketio-demo
```

3. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

4. Run server locally

```bash
npm start
```

5. Sample Output

```bash
☁  socketio-demo [main] npm start

> socketio-demo@1.0.0 start /socketio-demo
> nodemon server.js

[nodemon] 2.0.13
[nodemon] to restart at any time, enter `rs`
